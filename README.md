# About Dataset
The Advanced IoT Agriculture Dataset captures detailed physiological and morphological measurements of plants grown under two greenhouse settings (IoT‑enabled vs. traditional) at Tikrit University’s Agriculture Lab. Compiled by Mohammed Ismail Lifta (2023–2024) under the supervision of Prof. Wisam Dawood Abdullah, it comprises 30,000 records spanning 14 variables that quantify chlorophyll levels, growth rates, biomass (wet/dry weight), root metrics, and more, alongside a final categorical Class label.

Description
1. Data Collection
Location & Period: Agriculture Lab, College of Computer Science & Mathematics, Tikrit University, Iraq (2023–2024).
Greenhouse Types:
IoT Greenhouse: Plants monitored via sensors capturing real‑time chlorophyll, moisture, and growth data.
Traditional Greenhouse: Manually recorded metrics following standard sampling protocols.
Sampling: Randomized batches (Random identifiers R1–R3) to ensure representative coverage across plant stages and conditions.

3. Potential Use Cases
Environmental & Agricultural Research: Analyze how sensor‑driven IoT interventions impact plant health vs. traditional methods.
Machine Learning: Build classification models to predict treatment class from physiological features or regression models forecasting biomass and growth rates.
Plant Physiology Studies: Correlate chlorophyll content with leaf area, root architecture, and dry‑matter percentages.
